CREATE A PROJECT:
1. Open Eclipse and create a new Java Project: File->New->Java Project. This will open the 'Create a Java Project' dialog

2. Give the project a name and click 'Next' to go to the 'Java Settings'

3. On 'Java Settings' click 'Link additional source'. Browse to the directory <repository_home>/source/dayTrader. Click 'Ok', then 'Finish'.

4. Click 'Link additional source' again. Browse to the directory <repo_home>/IB/IBJts/IBJts/java. Click 'Ok'. In the folder name field delete 'java' 
	and replace it with 'ib'. Click Finish.

5. From the command line, make a copy of the file <repo_home>/source/user_libraries.userlibraries and in your copy replace all occurences of 
	"/home/nathan/dayTrader.git" with the path to the root of your local repo.

6. At the 'Java Settings' dialog again, select the 'Libraries' tab. Click "Add Library...". 

7. Select 'User Library' and click 'Next'. Click 'User Libraries'. Click 'Import...'. Click 'Browse'  and browse to the location of your saved off 
	user_libraries.userlibraries file. Click 'Ok'. Select all libraries (there should be 5 libs) and click 'Ok'. Click 'Ok'. Click 'Finish'.

8. You should be back at the 'Java Settings' dialog now, click 'Finish'.

9. Use the 'Package Explorer' (Window->Show View->Package Explorer if it's not open by default) and find the folder 'src'. Right click the folder and delete.

SETTING EDITOR PREFERENCES
Ecplise gives you a ton of options to customize your editor for all kinds of different things. I'm only going to tell you to set one setting, but you can 
configure the others as you like.

1. Open Window->Preferences. Navigate to General->Editors->Text Editors. Set 'Displayed Tab Width' to 4 and ensure 'Insert spaces for tabs' is checked.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM:
To run the program from Eclipse:

1. Select the project folder from the Project Explorer pane. Select menu Run->Run. 

2. The first time you do this it will give a prompt of 'Select a way to run <project>'. Select 'Java Application' and click OK.

3. On the next dialog, enter 'DayTrader' in the text field, and then select the DayTrader_T class. Click OK and your project will run. 

Eclipse will remember these setting and next time you run the project, it will not prompt you.
