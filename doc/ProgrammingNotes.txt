Some general notes on the structure of the program. 

The application will enter with the DayTrader_T class. The main() method of this class should invoke the initialize() method which in turn will invoke all the intialize() methods for the appropriate managers/classes. Once initialization is complete the run() method should be called to enter the running state of the application. The DayTrader_T.run() method will invoke the run method for all the other managers/classes. 

We should create wrapper classes for all the IB classes that we need to interact with. This will provide a layer of abstraction between our application and the IB API should the API change or we ever decide to use another API.


Coding standards:

All classes should be appended with "_T" (for Type) to distinguish our classes from IB API classes. Similarly, interfaces should end with "_IF" and enums with "_E"
